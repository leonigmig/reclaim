Mancuso always seemed rather more a product of the summer of love and hippiedom than the burgeoning club culture 
of post-Stonewall New York. Before the Loft, he was a regular at psychedelic venues the Electric Circus and Fillmore East.

    “listening to birds, lying next to a spring and listening to water go across the rocks … there were times when 
    it would be intense, and times when it would be very soft”

Mancuso manipulated music to create an atmosphere and tell a story; taking the crowd on a journey. He required 
that the music played had to be soulful, rhythmic, and impart words of hope, redemption, or pride.

    “I don’t like to go in situations that are overcrowded; where you can’t dance or where the sound system is so 
    overpowering that your ears are ringing or where beer costs $7 a bottle – this is what I am rebelling against.”

Electronics convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents via suitably shaped conductors, electricity 
permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances and into people's
homes. The signals have been stored magnetically then processed into digital information by a series of technological 
transformations. Modern network and computing systems allow them to be reproduced in an appropraite medium on demand.
