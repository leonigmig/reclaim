I don’t like to go in situations that are overcrowded; where you can’t dance or where the sound system is so overpowering 
that your ears are ringing or where beer costs $7 a bottle – this is what I am rebelling against.

The DJ as someone who could manipulate music 
to create an atmosphere and tell a story; to – in that oft-abused cliche – take the crowd on a journey.

    “listening to birds, lying next to a spring and listening to water go across the rocks … there
 were times when it would be intense, and times when it would be very soft”.

Electronics convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents, and via suitably shaped conductors, electricity 
permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances. 

Mancuso always seemed rather more a product of the summer of love and hippiedom than the burgeoning club culture of post-Stonewall
 New York. Before the Loft, he was a regular at psychedelic venues the Electric Circus and Fillmore East
