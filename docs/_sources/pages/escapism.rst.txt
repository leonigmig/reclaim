`Counterculture`_ and Escapism
------------------------------

People will experience so much of the material living conditions as outside their nexus of control, they 
will start to seek other groups and cultures which promise to better fulfil their `needs`_.

The attempt to avoid awareness of aversive beliefs. The function of escapism is a compensation for exposure to other irrational patterns of belief formation, particular in 
so far as those belief systems would lead to dispair. 

New York Disco scene in early 70s
---------------------------------

Mancuso always seemed rather more a product of the summer of love and hippiedom than the burgeoning club culture 
of post-Stonewall New York. Before the Loft, he was a regular at psychedelic venues the Electric Circus and Fillmore East.

    “listening to birds, lying next to a spring and listening to water go across the rocks … there were times when 
    it would be intense, and times when it would be very soft”

Mancuso manipulated music to create an atmosphere and tell a story; taking the crowd on a journey. He required 
that the music played had to be soulful, rhythmic, and impart words of hope, redemption, or pride.

He said:

    “I don’t like to go in situations that are overcrowded; where you can’t dance or where the sound system is so 
    overpowering that your ears are ringing or where beer costs $7 a bottle – this is what I am rebelling against.”

As a child in Jamaica, Grace Jones had only one schoolfriend and was teased by classmates for her "skinny frame". Moving to the
US at 13 she "absolutely hated" her mother's new husband, he regularly beat her in what Jones described as "serious abuse". As
a young woman she immersed herself in the Counterculture of the 1960s by living in hippie communes, earning money as a go-go dancer, 
and using LSD and other drugs. She later praised the use of LSD as "a very important part of my emotional growth... The mental 
exercise was good for me".

     "Ultimately, it required a certain amount of clear thinking, a lot of hard work and good make-up to be accepted as a freak."

Some notions about drugs - looking culturally that seems to be where the openness came from in the rave cultural explosion. Danger to breweries!

Confluence of free parties and promoters making money

* New age travellers
* Yuppies
* Football hooligans

It was then suppressed and made less danger of an epidemic. 

Technology part of the drivers, backdrop.
