Open-ended consciousness

Trancendentalism
================

 Helmholtz’s account of differential consciousness, resists binary view in favor of a fluidity that moves 
 between the strict empiricist position that that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience
 and a transcendental idealism which holds  a belief in the essential unity of all creation, 
 the innate goodness of humanity, and the supremacy of insight over logic and experience for the revelation 
 of the deepest truths. 
  


Minimalism
==========

The origins of minimalism are contested.

    "During this period of concentration, I created a monotone symphony whose theme expresses what I wished my life to be." – Yves Klein

LaMonte Young was born in a log cabin in Bern, Idaho. As a child he was influenced by the droning sounds of the environment, such as blowing wind and electrical transformers. 

According to Young himself, "Nobody ever took an interest in writing sustained tones without melodies over them before me."

"What La Monte introduced was this concept of not having to press ahead to create interest. He would wait for the music to take its own course."
