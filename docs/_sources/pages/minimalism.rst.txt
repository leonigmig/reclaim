Minimalism
==========

The origins of minimalism are contested.

    "During this period of concentration, I created a monotone symphony whose theme expresses what I wished my life to be." â€“ Yves Klein

LaMonte Young was born in a log cabin in Bern, Idaho. As a child he was influenced by the droning sounds of the environment, such as blowing wind and electrical transformers. 

According to Young himself, "Nobody ever took an interest in writing sustained tones without melodies over them before me."

"What La Monte introduced was this concept of not having to press ahead to create interest. He would wait for the music to take its own course."

Rave scene in the late 80s/early 90s
====================================

* Chernobyl
* Shelling of Russian parliament
* Hubble space telescope
* Dolly the sheep

Some notions about drugs - looking culturally that seems to be where the openness came from in the rave cultural explosion. Danger to breweries!

Confluence of free parties and promoters making money

* New age travellers
* Yuppies
* Football hooligans

It was then suppressed and made less danger of an epidemic. 

Technology part of the drivers, backdrop

Conceptions of time
===================

Conceptions of time as a linear construct predominate today.

Developed  from monotheistic religions with the  idea of salvation  
as a process directed into the future. 

The linear  conception of time finds shape  in  the scientific-technological advances 
of  modernity. The spring wound mechanical  clock  in  the  fourteenth  century.

Newtonian  physics establishes time as a quantifiable  arrow  of  time.  Time  
itself  runs  on  and  does  not return. 

However, notions of non-linear (periodic or cycical) time remain:

* Human Body (heartbeat, respiration, sleep-wake cycle, circadian hormone secretion, among others)
* Bantu culture
* Nietzsche (western philosopher)
* La Monte Young
* `Gene Ray`_

The phenomenal sense of temporal continuity is periodic.
