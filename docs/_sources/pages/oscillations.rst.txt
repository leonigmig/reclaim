Nature as objects of respect and wonder as opposed to standing reserve

What we ‘first’ hear is never noises or complexes of sounds, but the creaking waggon, the motor-cycle. We hear the column on the march, the north wind, the woodpecker tapping, the fire crackling… It requires a very artificial and complicated frame of mind to ‘hear’ a ‘pure noise’.

Causal mechanisms
-----------------

Electronics convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents via suitably shaped conductors, electricity 
permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances and into people's
homes. The signals have been stored magnetically then processed into digital information by a series of technological 
transformations. Modern network and computing systems allow them to be reproduced in an appropraite medium on demand. 


Purpose
-------

The idea that we have no purpose is nonsense. If the field we inhabit is indeed infinite and multi-dimensional,
then there must be some regularity in how things are distributed in time and space, in order to explain our
subjective experience of time. That we are aligned with this regularity is sufficient to prove we have purpose. 

 For example we are only successful as a species when we are able to procreate. Many of our structural characteristics 
 and experiences from youth through to late middle age are conditioned by this urge. This is an example of a deep 
 structural chacteristic being causally associated in time with success.
