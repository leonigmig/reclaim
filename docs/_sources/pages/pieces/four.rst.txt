Shape of the song form
====================== 

Alexis MMT8 
-----------

- Concept of Parts
- Not step - quantisation
- No overdub
- Records MIDI cc 

"The MMT-8 can play back 8 tracks simultaneously and it functions in many ways like an 8 track tape
recorder. Each set of 8 tracks is called a part."

"By constructing songs in this fashion, the MMT-8 makes it very easy to arrange songs by recording one
verse into one part, and a chorus into another, and a bridge into another, and then making a list of the
parts into a song with as many verses, choruses, and bridges as desired."

Structure to try out 
--------------------

Based on listening to spare parts express and nothing left part i and ii 

Parts can be 2 bars or  - but played as 4 bars using fill

4 to the floor thudding away
Groove had to work on dancefloor

Roots and sources 
=================

Inspired by early Orbital stuff 

..  youtube:: VjlWypTclec

Warm and fluffy vs. sharp and surgical

Grit

Virus - feedback on delay - let it build
Crunchy distortion element to it 

BS2
Syncable LFO - stepped octaves - satan - messy
volume of osciallators - battle against each other

Electric and aggressive - kind of like rhythm guitarist. Not the deep low end

Fading between the oscillators

Deep electric dramatic mono bassy sound at 7m with loads of reverb - m1000?

low pass filter to disappear it 

.. youtube:: 77nsZo_F4zw

Everything - write, record

Scratching the surface rather than digging in 
Two or three things for each project (islands)

Exploring synths to fully learn them. Know them inside out

Oberheim Expander
Roland Jupiter 8

Chime: 909, DX100 Solid Bass, 303, Akai Sampler, MMT8

Caberet Voltaire, Psychedelia, Punk, Dead Kennedy's, 9 Inch Nails, New Order, Electro, HiNRG Disco

Top of the Pops 90s "double keyboard wizard act"

"Full on techno and Acid House"

"Don't use presets"

.. youtube:: hjZ_8f5CJLg

Rave was a change in attitude

Feedback loop with the audience

Tease them by taking it right back to the bassline
