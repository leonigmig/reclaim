*********************************
Recording studio as an instrument
*********************************

Process 
-------

Create sound environment
Create midi
Mangle audio
Mixdown audio 

Structure
---------

User interface
Programming 
Network 

Operating over time
- time as measurement of periods of vibrations
- root of all structure : le monte


Entrainment and Harmonics
-------------------------

Theta waves are:
- 6-10hz
- 6-7hz

6 = 166ms
10 = 100ms


Layers
------

Arrangement
Progression
Phrase
Rhythm
Bass 
Voice
Voice
Voice



Songs 
-----

Voices with patterns of notes
- with a fractaline structure 
- which refer back the bass tonality 

Upto 3 independent voices - harmony or counterpoint 
Yet may be multi-timbral

Harmonic series

- Music structure
  - Arrwngment
  - Phrases 
  - Progression 
  - Resolution 

3 minutes
engaging beginning
proceed by addition of parts 
consistent bass tonality
connection of bass to rhythm
introduce chorus, proceed to creccendo
Harmony, progression and modulation 
tempo the same

Phrases 
-------

Tone, separation, integration and grouping

rhythm
Syncopation as a cognitive mechanism has been described as a form of violation of metrical expectations
nueral entrainment and rhythm - perceptual 1.5 seconds - sensitive to it
metric hierarchy, assymetries, polyrhythms
syncopation, weak beats, groove and dancing

pitch, 

- Fundamental frequency 
- Harmonics 

sethares

timbre, 
timbre as rise time, spectral centoid, spectral flux, noise content

Entrained to 250ms
------------------

schaffer

- Envelope 
- Attack log spectral centre 
- exaption - ear / mouth / vowel / consonent
- ossicles, tongue

- Vibrato 




balance, evenness, and interonset interval entropy



Heterarchy

Basic ontology of instrumental capabilities 

Gear and configuration
----------------------

Getting everything setup nicely around sound is a nightmare. Having messed around a lot here's where I have ended Upto

1/ DT overbridge to bitwig
2/ USB interface takes all audio 
3/ all midi turned off just using overbridge
4/ remove all pesky plugins which introduce latency
5/ configure negative 25ms and latency within around 5ms



White noise and ambience
------------------------
