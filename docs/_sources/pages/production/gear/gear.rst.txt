LaMonte Young was born in a log cabin in Bern, Idaho. As a child he was influenced by the droning sounds of the environment, such as blowing wind and electrical transformers.

According to Young himself, "Nobody ever took an interest in writing sustained tones without melodies over them before me."

"What La Monte introduced was this concept of not having to press ahead to create interest. He would wait for the music to take its own course."

 sizzle on hihats: a steep positive high shelf, try 6-8K.
a lot of roundness, as well as 400-800 Hz boost on the kick.
kick is pitched up and has a higher pitch than normally.

a lot of midrange boost on the snare (find the sweet spot between 800–1.5K)

plenty of sizzle in the hihats

all drumsounds nicely apart from each other freq-wise

roast the drums in an analog desk…hit that red sweet spot

really round, lack of heavy transients…that's oldskool for you, kids!

...Distort, Saturate, Filter, FX etc...I think Camel Phat is the closest thing I have to an analogue distortion effect.

(drums)

The trick to the fat drumsounds is appropriate use of distortion/compression/transient shaping/dynamic range control and frequency control (EQ or layering). Ideally you want your drums to fill the entire frequency spectrum and have a lot of width. Particularly the snare should be looking like an inverse fletscher mundson curve if you want a very heavy snare. Furthermore, everyone got their own little secrets to make things even fatter, stereo width, peak EQing, assigning EQs to envelopes etc. The mix plays a big part in that too, sidechain the kick to the bass, snares to synths, widen synths where they intefere with the snare and kick etc.

Breaks are always a case of finding a loop you like, then cutting it up VERY carefully and putting into your DAW in time, the I would chuck out any weak hits and replace them with stronger ones, move around the hits to get a groove I like, perhaps use a volume envelope to shape them to fit my track properly, the when I have something that works well I ask myself...is the snare or kik powerful enough? Are the hats noisy or crackly? are there any weak parts, any hits that sound too loud or quiet? I now try to work out all these issues and finally I would layer up the kik and snare with something generic I know will have good power underneath to pad out my break, finally I would layer hats carefully over the break to enhance in its rhythm and improve clarity in the top.

In the analogue world I used to send the buss to my Focusrite Green EQ's and do both saturation - by pushing the input gain or maybe output gain into clipping slightly...red lights bouncing on and off...then used a Low cut filter cutting off any rumble (30-40hz 24db Highpass Filter), I gave the beat a bit of shaping with eq section, all eq's were on widest q that they could be...this is smooth eq'ing not anything drastic...just to fit the track and make it 'pop'. In a DAW I buss the drums then saturate with say Camel Phat or sometimes Sonnox Limiter set to 0db and a bit of Enhance (25%). I would avoid anything else too much...maybe a small amount of a solid sounding compressor to just glue it but try not to let it 'pump' or that will make mixing down really hard. I may use an eq on the buss just to pick out some bite and perhaps cut the sub freqs with a highpass but I would EQ individual drum channels before doing the buss channel as it affects everything. I might leave rides and crashes out of the drum buss to make them and clean as possible and perhaps wider and more out there than the main drum loop.

Woa at those vintage prices! I wonder if they will rise up in price later like old analogs, probably not, they're too niche.

The most important difference is that the E5000 has only 4 outs, the other models 8 outs. Just make sure it has the max 128MB RAM, the maximum for all models (or you have to hunt SIMMs yourself).

Then put in one of these:
