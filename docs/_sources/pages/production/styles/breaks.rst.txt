Our music continues the vibe of old school rave where you could sample anything, make music at any tempo and mash it up.

Break Programming
-----------------

definitely use 16 lpb, and use ghost snares (snares w/ vol column at like 10-40) and shuffles to fill out space. and try to create a call & response relationship between the kicks and snares. and just pay attention to how good jungle songs do their drums, like where exactly they put the snares etc., and try to learn from that. also try layering different breaks and bringing in other breaks for fills


 or chop it up and reprogram it so each sound has its own track (to process). hat, kick, snare, whatever. 


split the break into three bands, hi, mid, & lows. process each one to taste then blend them together.
