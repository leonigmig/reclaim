Conceptions of time

Linear time and modernity
-------------------------

The linear conception of time dominates the modern world. It bids us to construct it.

Bronze age, monotheistic religions had the idea of salvation:
a process directed into the future. Technology certainly works that way. The spring wound 
mechanical clocks used in fourteenth  century were a prelude to the scientific-technological advances 
of  modernity. Newton's  physics established time as a quantifiable  arrow. The Great Western Railway 
syncronised railway time across England in November 1840.

Time becomes a loop
-------------------

Today we are certain that time  itself  runs  on  and  does  not return. However, notions of non-linear 
(periodic or cycical) time remain. The phenomenal sense of temporal continuity is periodic.

A mind that seeks
-----------------

The circular experience of time, our experience of time, syncronised with the world. A mind which 
rewards just-manageable challenges, clear proximal goals, and immediate feedback. Inventive and 
curious behavoiral traits. Friendly or compassionate engagemen with others. A sensitive or nervous 
affect.

The presence in time of concious control. The sub-conscious which notices small details and defends.
The regulator is phasic dopaminergic signaling that orients us toward novel, surprising, or uncertain stimuli. And 
meta-monitoring processes that track our learning progress and stop us getting trapped. The illusion of 
self-determination. The invisible gold which mixes us from ourselves.

Sound and time
--------------

Because sound is a wave, it necessarily exists in time. As the neurons in the brain fire, the ion gates embedded
in each one have to open up to allow time to pass. These nuerons are in some cases connected to the perceptual apparatus 
of the auditory system in human head, and ultimately the ears. As the conciousness projects its expectations along
the perceptual channels of hearing in the human mind the sounds we are able to hear are characterised by being 
harmonic, or noisey, or like vowels or more rhythmic constants. 

This aligns with the nature of language as a social technology we use to co-ordinate with each other through time. 
For example the development of the mouth has meant that speech allows us to be heard. Listening is in an evolutionary
necessity if beings are going to communicate in the way that we do. This is bourne out by the fact that spoken language
develops much earlier and more consistently than written language, or networked computer use.
