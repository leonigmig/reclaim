Conceptions of time
*******************

The linear conception of time dominates the modern world. It bids us to construct it.

Bronze age, monotheistic religions had the idea of salvation:
a process directed into the future. Technology certainly works that way. The spring wound 
mechanical clocks used in fourteenth  century were a prelude to the scientific-technological advances 
of  modernity. Newton's  physics established time as a quantifiable  arrow. The Great Western Railway 
syncronised railway time across England in November 1840.

Today we are certain that time  itself  runs  on  and  does  not return. However, notions of non-linear 
(periodic or cycical) time remain. The phenomenal sense of temporal continuity is periodic.
