Mirror neutrons seem a closer match

We have emotions thought of as unconscious, or deeper than conscious constructs and foundations

The mirror can be the mimic, the memory, harmonious and engaged. Or the overwrought defensive model that embeds nuerosis, fight, flight, freeze.

The layer in between the stable and the varying

Able to speak and hear - highly evolved categories

through a practice of deep listening, an awareness of the spatiality of sound phenomenon

Take some of these escapist ideas seriously

Some notions about drugs - looking culturally that seems to be where the openness came from in the rave cultural explosion. Danger to breweries!

Confluence of free parties and promoters making money

* New age travellers
* Yuppies
* Football hooligans

It was then suppressed and made less danger of an epidemic. 

Technology part of the drivers, backdrop

conceptions of time
*******************

Conceptions of time as a linear construct predominate today.

Developed  from monotheistic religoin with the  idea of  a  history of  salvation  
as  a process directed into the future. This process reaches its goal in the appearance 
of the Messiah or in the Parousia of the  Lord: then, indeed, time itself 
will end  again (Achtner  et  al.,  1998).  However,  the linear  conception 
of time finds its  actual  shape  in  the scientific-technological advances 
of  modernity:  in  the  first  place,  human  cultural  products,  from  the 
mechanical  clock  in  the  fourteenth  century  to  the  continually 
accelerated  means  of  transportation  in  the  nineteenth  and  twentieth 
centuries,  create  and  establish  the  idea  of  time  as  a  continually 
progressive  flow  in close  connection  with Newtonian  physics (Elias, 
2007). Here, time was  conceived as an homogeneous, steadily quanti-
fiable  arrow  of  time.  On  this  arrow,  each  event  can  only  hold  one 
irreversibly  passing  position;  for  time  itself  runs  on  and  does  not 
return. But this linear, homogeneous time, abstracted from all concrete 
processes,  does  not  show  itself  in  the  natural  world  pre-given  to 
humans  â€”  here  we  encounter  initially  only  cyclical,  recurring,  or 
finalizing prossesses.  Rather, the linear  concept of time  was first con-
structed in  the  cultural world  shaped by  man and  then  transferred to 
cosmic processes. 

However, notions of non-linear (periodic or cycical) time remain:

* Human Body (heartbeat, respiration, sleep-wake cycle, circadian hormone secretion, among others)
* Bantu culture
* Nietzsche (western philosopher)
* La Monte Young
* `Gene Ray`_

The phenomenal sense of temporal continuity is periodic.
