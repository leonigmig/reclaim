the coming transmission system

described by `FSOL`_ as the journey from millennial claustrophobia to open-ended cosmic consciousness

To me the word psychedelia relates to the natural state of a child

Mirror neutrons seem a closer match

We have emotions thought of as unconscious, or deeper than conscious constructs and foundations

The mirror can be the mimic, the memory, harmonious and engaged. Or the overwrought defensive model that embeds nuerosis, fight, flight, freeze.

The layer in between the stable and the varying

Able to speak and hear - highly evolved categories

through a practice of deep listening, an awareness of the spatiality of sound phenomenon

Take some of these escapist ideas seriously

Some notions about drugs - looking culturally that seems to be where the openness came from in the rave cultural explosion. Danger to breweries!

Confluence of free parties and promoters making money

* New age travellers
* Yuppies
* Football hooligans

It was then suppressed and made less danger of an epidemic.

conceptions of time
*******************

Conceptions of time as a linear construct predominate today.

Developed  from monotheistic religions with the  idea of salvation  
as a process directed into the future. 

The linear  conception of time finds shape  in  the scientific-technological advances 
of  modernity. The spring wound mechanical  clock  in  the  fourteenth  century.

Newtonian  physics establishes time as a quantifiable  arrow  of  time.  Time  
itself  runs  on  and  does  not return. 

However, notions of non-linear (periodic or cycical) time remain:

* Human Body (heartbeat, respiration, sleep-wake cycle, circadian hormone secretion, among others)
* Bantu culture
* Nietzsche (western philosopher)
* La Monte Young
* `Gene Ray`_

The phenomenal sense of temporal continuity is periodic.
