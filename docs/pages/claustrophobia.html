<p>The starting point is dystopic claustrophobia.</p>

<h2>Linear time and modernity<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-time-and-modernity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The modern world is dominated by the linear conception of time. This is the conceptual trap we humans fell into 350 years ago. The hope of progress entices us, again and again, to endlessly and meaninglessly construct and expand the technological world around us.</p>
<img alt="../_images/linear_time.webp" src="../_images/linear_time.webp" />
<p>How did it happen? In the bronze age, impoverished people following monotheistic religions had the idea of salvation: a process directed into the future. The spring wound mechanical clocks used in fourteenth century were a prelude to the technological advances of modernity. Newton established time as a quantifiable arrow.</p>
<img alt="../_images/blackcountrynight.jpg" src="../_images/blackcountrynight.jpg" />
<p>By November 1840 the  needs of the terrifying, smoke belching railway has synchonised time across the whole of England. Today everything is needlessly synchronised in a dystopia of unrestrained technology, Internet of corporate interests, attention hijack, disinformation, misinformation and trivia.</p>
<img alt="../_images/toomuch.png" src="../_images/toomuch.png" />
<p>This unweildy machine has become the neurotic cage of billions of overwrought souls. Alienated from more natural surroundings the instincts to fight, fly away or freeze in terror flap like bloody wings against the metal walls of the underground containers constructed to house us. And we flap our bloody wings against each other.</p>

<h2>A mind that seeks to to trancend<a class="headerlink" href="#a-mind-that-seeks-to-to-trancend" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Those changes which [we] can bring forth and annul by conscious
impulses of the will are to be distinguished from those which are
not consequences of the will’s impulses and cannot be overcome by
such.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Helmholtz’s account of differential consciousness, resists binary view in favor of a fluidity that moves
between the strict empiricist position that that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience
and a transcendental idealism which holds  a belief in the essential unity of all creation,
the innate goodness of humanity, and the supremacy of insight over logic and experience for the revelation
of the deepest truths.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The circular experience of time, our experience of time, syncronised with the world. A mind which
rewards just-manageable challenges, clear proximal goals, and immediate feedback. Inventive and
curious behavoiral traits. Friendly or compassionate engagemen with others. A sensitive or nervous
affect.</p>
<img alt="../_images/sync.jpg" src="../_images/sync.jpg" />
<p>The presence in time of concious control. The sub-conscious which notices small details and defends.
The regulator is phasic dopaminergic signaling that orients us toward novel, surprising, or uncertain stimuli. And
meta-monitoring processes that track our learning progress and stop us getting trapped. The illusion of
self-determination. The invisible gold which mixes us from ourselves.</p>
<p>Dystopic claustraphobia is nothing new. The goal is not to revolutionise it. To
follow a well trodden, but still dangerous path. But to live in a way that escapes or evades the closing in.</p>
