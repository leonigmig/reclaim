<h2>A mind that seeks to to trancend<a class="headerlink" href="#a-mind-that-seeks-to-to-trancend" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A belief in the essential unity of all creation, the innate goodness of humanity, and the supremacy of insight over logic and experience for the revelation of the deepest truths.</p>
<p>Those changes which we can bring forth and annul by conscious impulses of the will are to be distinguished from those which are
instinctive. Resists binary view in favor of a fluidity that moves between the strict empiricist position that that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience</p>
<section id="field-dynamics">
<h3>Field Dynamics<a class="headerlink" href="#field-dynamics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Able to speak and hear - highly evolved categories. We ourselves are simply complex disturbances of quantum fields, able
to emit and recieve. We have emotions thought of as unconscious, or deeper than conscious constructs and foundations. These
internal fields are how we tell stories to ourselves as we pass through time. Nature as objects of respect and wonder as opposed to standing reserve</p>
<p>What we ‘first’ hear is never noises or complexes of sounds, but the creaking waggon, the motor-cycle. We hear the column on the march, the north wind, the woodpecker tapping, the fire crackling… It requires a very artificial and complicated frame of mind to ‘hear’ a ‘pure noise’.</p>

<h3>Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“During this period of concentration, I created a monotone symphony whose theme expresses what I wished my life to be.” – Yves Klein</p>
</div></blockquote>
<img alt="../../_images/yves9.jpg" src="../../_images/yves9.jpg" />
<p>The idea that we have no purpose is nonsense. If the field we inhabit is indeed infinite and multi-dimensional,
then there must be some regularity in how things are distributed in time and space, in order to explain our
subjective experience of time. That we are aligned with this regularity is sufficient to prove we have purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For example we are only successful as a species when we are able to procreate. Many of our structural characteristics
and experiences from youth through to late middle age are conditioned by this urge. This is an example of a deep
structural chacteristic being causally associated in time with success.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Psychedelia relates to the natural state of a child. Naive mirror neutrons captured in their elemental state of awe. The mirror can be the mimic, the memory, harmonious and engaged.
Ordered reflections. Dreams and visions and emotions. The layer in between the stable and the varying. Repose in the sensation that rests us from intense compulsion to focus, analyse, frame, categorise, isolate.
That which energises us makes us live richly. That which reinforces support emotional freedom. Close friends and family help us maintain perspective and laugh.</p>
<p>Through a practice of deep listening, an awareness of the spatiality of sound phenomenon. Take some of these escapist ideas seriously.</p>

<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_1960s_counterculture">Counterculture</a> and Escapism<a class="headerlink" href="#counterculture-and-escapism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When people experience their material living conditions as outside their nexus of control, they start to seek other groups and cultures which promise to better fulfil their <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_True_Believer">needs</a>. The function of escapism is a compensation for exposure to other irrational patterns of belief formation, particular in so far as those belief systems would lead to dispair. They attempt to avoid awareness of the aversive beliefs the technology dystopia engenders.</p>

<h2>Bacchus Dance<a class="headerlink" href="#bacchus-dance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="../../_images/fresco.jpg" src="../../_images/fresco.jpg" />
<p>The ancient greeks used strings, pipes and song to make music together in symposiums - translated as ‘drinking together’. In this patriarchal
culture, a female slave might be asked to play a song about love on her Aulos. Participants would give improvisational
performances as the party developed.</p>
<p>“Let us hang garlands of celery across our foreheads and call a festival to Dionysus”</p>
<p>Also known as Bacchus (Βάκχος), Dionysus was the god of the grape-harvest, winemaking, orchards and fruit, fertility, insanity, ritual madness,
religious ecstasy and festivity in ancient Greek religion and myth. As Eleutherios (“the liberator”), his wine, music, and ecstatic dance
left his followers free from self-conscious fear and the oppressive restraints of the powerful.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/bacchic.jpg" src="../../_images/bacchic.jpg" />
<p>Nietzsche describes ancient greek musical rituals that he believed transcended the pessimism and nihilism of a fundamentally meaningless
world. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering and affirming it, passionately and joyously affirmed the
meaning of their own existence. They knew themselves to be infinitely more than petty individuals, finding self-affirmation not in
another life, not in a world to come, but in the terror and ecstasy alike celebrated in the performance of tragedies.</p>

<p>Mancuso always seemed rather more a product of the summer of love and hippiedom than the burgeoning club culture
of post-Stonewall New York. Before the Loft, he was a regular at psychedelic venues the Electric Circus and Fillmore East.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“listening to birds, lying next to a spring and listening to water go across the rocks … there were times when
it would be intense, and times when it would be very soft”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Mancuso manipulated music to create an atmosphere and tell a story; taking the crowd on a journey. He required
that the music played had to be soulful, rhythmic, and impart words of hope, redemption, or pride.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>“I don’t like to go in situations that are overcrowded; where you can’t dance or where the sound system is so
overpowering that your ears are ringing or where beer costs $7 a bottle – this is what I am rebelling against.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As a child in Jamaica, Grace Jones had only one schoolfriend and was teased by classmates for her “skinny frame”. Moving to the
US at 13 she “absolutely hated” her mother’s new husband, he regularly beat her in what Jones described as “serious abuse”. As
a young woman she immersed herself in the Counterculture of the 1960s by living in hippie communes, earning money as a go-go dancer,
and using LSD and other drugs. She later praised the use of LSD as “a very important part of my emotional growth… The mental
exercise was good for me”.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Ultimately, it required a certain amount of clear thinking, a lot of hard work and good make-up to be accepted as a freak.”</p>
