<p>Euler’s notion that the human mind has peculiar pleasure in simple ratio</p>
<p>The circular experience of time, our experience of time, syncronised with the world. A mind which
rewards just-manageable challenges, clear proximal goals, and immediate feedback. Inventive and
curious behavoiral traits. Friendly or compassionate engagemen with others. A sensitive or nervous
affect.</p>

<p>The presence in time of concious control. The sub-conscious which notices small details and defends.
The regulator is phasic dopaminergic signaling that orients us toward novel, surprising, or uncertain stimuli. And
meta-monitoring processes that track our learning progress and stop us getting trapped. The illusion of
self-determination. The invisible gold which mixes us from ourselves.</p>

<p>The origins of minimalism are contested.</p>
<p>LaMonte Young was born in a log cabin in Bern, Idaho. As a child he was influenced by the droning sounds of the environment, such as blowing wind and electrical transformers.</p>
<p>According to Young himself, “Nobody ever took an interest in writing sustained tones without melodies over them before me.”</p>
<p>“What La Monte introduced was this concept of not having to press ahead to create interest. He would wait for the music to take its own course.”</p>

<div><p>Helmholtz’s account of differential consciousness, resists binary view in favor of a fluidity that moves
between the strict empiricist position that that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience

the innate goodness of humanity, and the supremacy of insight over logic and experience for the revelation
of the deepest truths.</p>

<section id="sound-and-time">
<h2>Sound and time<a class="headerlink" href="#sound-and-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because sound is a wave, it necessarily exists in time. As the neurons in the brain fire, the ion gates embedded
in each one have to open up to allow time to pass. These nuerons are in some cases connected to the perceptual apparatus
of the auditory system in human head, and ultimately the ears. As the conciousness projects its expectations along
the perceptual channels of hearing in the human mind the sounds we are able to hear are characterised by being
harmonic, or noisey, or like vowels or more rhythmic constants.</p>
<p>This aligns with the nature of language as a social technology we use to co-ordinate with each other through time.
For example the development of the mouth has meant that speech allows us to be heard. Listening is in an evolutionary
necessity if beings are going to communicate in the way that we do. This is bourne out by the fact that spoken language
develops much earlier and more consistently than written language, or networked computer use.</p>

<p>describing the ways in which cognitive function results from brain activity. In turn, brain activity shows complex fluctuations, with structure at many spatio-temporal scales. Exactly how cognitive function inherits the physical dimensions of neural activity, though, is highly non-trivial, and so are generally the corresponding dimensions of cognitive phenomena. As for any physical phenomenon, when studying cognitive function, the first conceptual step should be that of establishing its dimensions.</p>

<p>The less we just stare at the hammer-thing, and the more we seize hold of it and use it, the more primordial does our relationship to it become, and the more unveiledly is it encountered as that which it is—as equipment. The hammering itself uncovers the specific ‘manipulability’ of the hammer. The kind of Being which equipment possesses—in which it manifests itself in its own right—we call ‘readiness-to-hand’.</p>

<h3>Field Dynamics<a class="headerlink" href="#field-dynamics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Able to speak and hear - highly evolved categories. We ourselves are simply complex disturbances of quantum fields, able
to emit and recieve. We have emotions thought of as unconscious, or deeper than conscious constructs and foundations. These
internal fields are how we tell stories to ourselves as we pass through time.</p>
<p>Nature as objects of respect and wonder as opposed to standing reserve</p>
<p>What we ‘first’ hear is never noises or complexes of sounds, but the creaking waggon, the motor-cycle. We hear the column on the march, the north wind, the woodpecker tapping, the fire crackling… It requires a very artificial and complicated frame of mind to ‘hear’ a ‘pure noise’.</p>

<img alt="../_images/yves9.jpg" src="../_images/yves9.jpg" />
<p>The idea that we have no purpose is nonsense. If the field we inhabit is indeed infinite and multi-dimensional,
then there must be some regularity in how things are distributed in time and space, in order to explain our
subjective experience of time. That we are aligned with this regularity is sufficient to prove we have purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For example we are only successful as a species when we are able to procreate. Many of our structural characteristics
and experiences from youth through to late middle age are conditioned by this urge. This is an example of a deep
structural chacteristic being causally associated in time with success.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Psychedelia relates to the natural state of a child. Naive mirror neutrons captured in their
elemental state of awe. The mirror can be the mimic, the memory, harmonious and engaged.</p>
<p>Ordered reflections. Dreams and visions and emotions. The layer in between the stable and the varying. Repose in the sensation that rests us from intense compulsion to focus, analyse, frame, categorise, isolate.
That which energises us makes us live richly. That which reinforces support emotional freedom. Close friends and family help us maintain perspective and laugh.</p>
<p>Through a practice of deep listening, an awareness of the spatiality of sound phenomenon. Take some of these escapist ideas seriously.</p>

<h2>Bacchus Dance<a class="headerlink" href="#bacchus-dance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="../_images/fresco.jpg" src="../_images/fresco.jpg" />
<p>The ancient greeks used strings, pipes and song to make music together in symposiums - translated as ‘drinking together’. In this patriarchal
culture, a female slave might be asked to play a song about love on her Aulos for a gathering of men. Participants would give improvisational
performances as the party developed.</p>
<p>“Let us hang garlands of celery across our foreheads and call a festival to Dionysus”</p>
<p>Also known as Bacchus (Βάκχος), Dionysus was the god of the grape-harvest, winemaking, orchards and fruit, fertility, insanity, ritual madness,
religious ecstasy and festivity in ancient Greek religion and myth. As Eleutherios (“the liberator”), his wine, music, and ecstatic dance
left his followers free from self-conscious fear and the oppressive restraints of the powerful.</p>
<img alt="../_images/bacchic.jpg" src="../_images/bacchic.jpg" />
<p>Nietzsche describes ancient greek musical rituals that he believed transcended the pessimism and nihilism of a fundamentally meaningless
world. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering and affirming it, passionately and joyously affirmed the
meaning of their own existence. They knew themselves to be infinitely more than petty individuals, finding self-affirmation not in
another life, not in a world to come, but in the terror and ecstasy alike celebrated in the performance of tragedies.</p>

<p>Mancuso always seemed rather more a product of the summer of love and hippiedom than the burgeoning club culture
of post-Stonewall New York. Before the Loft, he was a regular at psychedelic venues the Electric Circus and Fillmore East.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“listening to birds, lying next to a spring and listening to water go across the rocks … there were times when
it would be intense, and times when it would be very soft”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Mancuso manipulated music to create an atmosphere and tell a story; taking the crowd on a journey. He required
that the music played had to be soulful, rhythmic, and impart words of hope, redemption, or pride.</p>

<p>As a child in Jamaica, Grace Jones had only one schoolfriend and was teased by classmates for her “skinny frame”. Moving to the
US at 13 she “absolutely hated” her mother’s new husband, he regularly beat her in what Jones described as “serious abuse”. As
a young woman she immersed herself in the Counterculture of the 1960s by living in hippie communes, earning money as a go-go dancer,
and using LSD and other drugs. She later praised the use of LSD as “a very important part of my emotional growth… The mental
exercise was good for me”.</p>
