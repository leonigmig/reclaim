<p>mimetic / modality independent communication</p>
<p>Today we are certain that time  itself  runs  on  and  does  not return. However, notions of non-linear
(periodic or cycical) time remain. The phenomenal sense of temporal continuity is periodic.</p>

<h2>Sound and time<a class="headerlink" href="#sound-and-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because sound is a wave, it necessarily exists in time. As the neurons in the brain fire, the ion gates embedded
in each one have to open up to allow time to pass. These nuerons are in some cases connected to the perceptual apparatus
of the auditory system in human head, and ultimately the ears. As the conciousness projects its expectations along
the perceptual channels of hearing in the human mind the sounds we are able to hear are characterised by being
harmonic, or noisey, or like vowels or more rhythmic constants.</p>
<p>This aligns with the nature of language as a social technology we use to co-ordinate with each other through time.
For example the development of the mouth has meant that speech allows us to be heard. Listening is in an evolutionary
necessity if beings are going to communicate in the way that we do. This is bourne out by the fact that spoken language
develops much earlier and more consistently than written language, or networked computer use.</p>

<h2>The perception of sound<a class="headerlink" href="#the-perception-of-sound" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Acoustics proceeds as if sound were bare and empty of significance in a physics of the soundful</p>
<p>By living with electric instruments our experience of listening itself is being transformed, and included in this transformation are the ideas about ourselves and the world we inhabit</p>
<p>a discourse which seeks to unsettle the traditional ontological privilege of the visual in Western philosophy and explore various aspects of auditory phenomena and culture</p>

<section id="harmonic-experience">
<h2>Harmonic experience<a class="headerlink" href="#harmonic-experience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The phenomenal sense of temporal continuity is harmonic.</p>
<p>The relation of whole numbers to musical consanances was from all time looked upon as a wonderful mystery of deep
significance - Helmholtz</p>
<p>Euler’s notion that the human mind has peculiar pleasure in simple ratio</p>
<p>The circular experience of time, our experience of time, syncronised with the world. A mind which
rewards just-manageable challenges, clear proximal goals, and immediate feedback. Inventive and
curious behavoiral traits. Friendly or compassionate engagemen with others. A sensitive or nervous
affect.</p>
<img alt="../_images/sync.jpg" src="../_images/sync.jpg" />
<p>The presence in time of concious control. The sub-conscious which notices small details and defends.
The regulator is phasic dopaminergic signaling that orients us toward novel, surprising, or uncertain stimuli. And
meta-monitoring processes that track our learning progress and stop us getting trapped. The illusion of
self-determination. The invisible gold which mixes us from ourselves.</p>
