</iframe></div><p>The starting point is dystopic claustrophobia. Unrestrained technology, internet of corporate interests, attention hijack,
disinformation, misinformation and trivia. Yet distopic claustraphobia is nothing new. The goal is not to revolutionise it. To
follow a well trodden, but still dangerous path. But to live in a way that escapes or evades the closing in.</p>
<p>The enemy of the overwrought defensive model that embeds nuerosis, fight, flight, freeze.</p>
<section id="field-dynamics">
<h2>Field Dynamics<a class="headerlink" href="#field-dynamics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Able to speak and hear - highly evolved categories. We ourselves are simply complex disturbances of quantum fields, able
to emit and recieve. We have emotions thought of as unconscious, or deeper than conscious constructs and foundations. These
internal fields are how we tell stories to ourselves as we pass through time.</p>
<p>Nature as objects of respect and wonder as opposed to standing reserve</p>
<p>What we ‘first’ hear is never noises or complexes of sounds, but the creaking waggon, the motor-cycle. We hear the column on the march, the north wind, the woodpecker tapping, the fire crackling… It requires a very artificial and complicated frame of mind to ‘hear’ a ‘pure noise’.</p>

<section id="causal-mechanisms">
<h2>Causal mechanisms<a class="headerlink" href="#causal-mechanisms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="../_images/gluon.png" src="../_images/gluon.png" />
<p>Electronics convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents via suitably shaped conductors, electricity
permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances and into people’s
homes. The signals have been stored magnetically then processed into digital information by a series of technological
transformations. Modern network and computing systems allow them to be reproduced in an appropraite medium on demand.</p>

<section id="purpose">
<h2>Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The idea that we have no purpose is nonsense. If the field we inhabit is indeed infinite and multi-dimensional,
then there must be some regularity in how things are distributed in time and space, in order to explain our
subjective experience of time. That we are aligned with this regularity is sufficient to prove we have purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For example we are only successful as a species when we are able to procreate. Many of our structural characteristics
and experiences from youth through to late middle age are conditioned by this urge. This is an example of a deep
structural chacteristic being causally associated in time with success.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A system of transmission, described by <a class="reference external" href="http://fsolnews.blogspot.com/">FSOL</a> as the journey from millennial claustrophobia to open-ended cosmic consciousness.</p>
<p>Psychedelia relates to the natural state of a child. Naive mirror neutrons captured in their
elemental state of awe. The mirror can be the mimic, the memory, harmonious and engaged.</p>
<p>Ordered reflections. Dreams and visions and emotions. The layer in between the stable and the varying. Repose in the sensation that rests us from intense compulsion to focus, analyse, frame, categorise, isolate.
That which energises us makes us live richly. That which reinforces support emotional freedom. Close friends and family help us maintain perspective and laugh.</p>
<p>Through a practice of deep listening, an awareness of the spatiality of sound phenomenon. Take some of these escapist ideas seriously.</p>
