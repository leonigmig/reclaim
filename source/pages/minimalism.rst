LaMonte Young was born in a log cabin in Bern, Idaho. As a child he was influenced by the droning sounds of the environment, such as blowing wind and electrical transformers.

"What La Monte introduced was this concept of not having to press ahead to create interest. He would wait for the music to take its own course."
