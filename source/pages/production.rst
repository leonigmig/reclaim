*********************************
Recording studio as an instrument
*********************************

Rationale
---------

My process is based on the idea that the mind attends by similtaneously discriminating perceptual objects and integrating them into an experiential whole. It does 
this across multiple time frames similtaneously - harmonically- the concious (attending wavelengths between 1 and 40 seconds) and the sub-conscious (attending below 
200ms, upto 600hz - percieving effects in the 20khz range).

* Arrangement / Song (3 mins 30 seconds)
* Progression (slow 4 - 15-40 seconds)
* Phrase (slow 2/3 - 2-5 and 5-15 seconds)
* Rhythm (slow 1 - 2 seconds)
* Bass (theta)
* Voices (theta)

My idea is that the concious and the unconcious perceptions are glued together between the sub-consciously integrated bass tone and the conciously integrated rhythmic pattern. Basic 
repetition and variation sustains interest.

Process
-------

Create a walking skeleton through:

* Configure sonic environment
* Devise tonality and harmonic structure 
* Devise groove, motive and hooks
* Devise phrases, punctuations and elaborations
* Chart some courses through the labyrinth
* Mangle and mixdown audio 

Structure
---------

Configure sound generation environment

* Sound generators
* Control 
* User interface
* Programming 
* Network 

Layers
------





Songs 
-----

Voices with patterns of notes
- with a fractaline structure (shenker)
- which refer back the bass tonality 

Upto 3 independent voices - harmony or counterpoint 
Yet may be multi-timbral

Harmonic series

- Music structure
  - Arrwngment
  - Phrases 
  - Progression 
  - Resolution 

3 minutes
engaging beginning
proceed by addition of parts 
consistent bass tonality
connection of bass to rhythm
introduce chorus, proceed to creccendo
Harmony, progression and modulation 
tempo the same


Phrases 
-------

Tone, separation, integration and grouping

rhythm
Syncopation as a cognitive mechanism has been described as a form of violation of metrical expectations
nueral entrainment and rhythm - perceptual 1.5 seconds - sensitive to it
metric hierarchy, assymetries, polyrhythms
syncopation, weak beats, groove and dancing

pitch, 

- Fundamental frequency 
- Harmonics 

sethares

timbre, 
timbre as rise time, spectral centoid, spectral flux, noise content

Entrained to 250ms
------------------

schaffer

- Envelope 
- Attack log spectral centre 
- exaption - ear / mouth / vowel / consonent
- ossicles, tongue

- Vibrato 




balance, evenness, and interonset interval entropy



Heterarchy

Basic ontology of instrumental capabilities 

Gear and configuration
----------------------

Getting everything setup nicely around sound is a nightmare. Having messed around a lot here's where I have ended Upto

1/ DT overbridge to bitwig
2/ USB interface takes all audio 
3/ all midi turned off just using overbridge
4/ remove all pesky plugins which introduce latency
5/ configure negative 25ms and latency within around 5ms



White noise and ambience
