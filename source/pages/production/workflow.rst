Workflow
--------

* Transformation of present into its fulfilment, tension and release
* repetition and variation sustains interest.

<sub conscious attention forces>
rhythm four bars long
percussion loop 8 bars long
piano part that's 16 bars long
pad part that's 32 bars long
<decoration or garnish>

Each part would have a kind of fill or flourish at the end of it
when they coincide they create a kind of internal 32 bar structure
exploiting flourishes to introduce the next element. 

Subdivision of time
===================

Listener/composer discriminates perceptual objects on multiple time frames similtaneously and integrates them into an experiential whole. balance, evenness, and interonset interval entropy fractaline qualities

*Symphonic wave* is like intro-breakdown-drop-rinse-breakdown-drop-rinse-outro. Devise tonality and harmonic structure 
Wavelength is around 3.34m. consistent tempo per wave. 

*Development waves* create interest every 32 bars say, change 2 a different loop. every 16 bars add or take away a track ov the tune.
Wavelength is around 15 seconds to 40 seconds. punctuations and elaborations. engaging beginning, proceed by addition of parts. small incremental changes - very small. linking passages sometimes needed.

*Constituent waves* phrases where use a crash, or a drum roll to minimize monotony. 8 bar segments where the end 4th fake but the end of 8th real. call and response -- essentially taking just one slot in turns. motive and hooks
Voices with patterns of notes
- with a fractaline structure (shenker)

*Rhythum or groove* slow 1-2 second wavelength. connects to walking running awareness etc. connection of bass to rhythm
Syncopation as a cognitive mechanism has been described as a form of violation of metrical expectations
nueral entrainment and rhythm - perceptual 1.5 seconds - sensitive to it
metric hierarchy, assymetries, polyrhythms
syncopation, weak beats, groove and dancing

Harrmonically- the concious (attending wavelengths between 1 and 40 seconds) and the sub-conscious (attending below 
200ms, upto 600hz - percieving effects in the 20khz range). Concious and the unconcious perceptions are glued together between the sub-consciously integrated bass tone and the conciously integrated rhythmic pattern. 

*Tonal Bass and voices theta*

harmonically relates which refer back the bass tonality Fundamental frequency 
Harmonic series. sethares

*Timbral bass and voices**

Tone, separation, integration and grouping entrained to 250ms. schaffer. Envelope, Attack log spectral centre, exaption - ear / mouth / vowel / consonent. ossicles, tongue, Vibrato 
Upto 3 independent voices - harmony or counterpoint 
Yet may be multi-timbral. timbre as rise time, spectral centoid, spectral flux, noise content

Reentrant control of voices 
===========================

Heterarchy. Each voice is configured inside a sonic environment.

Basic ontology of instrumental capabilities, Synth Stack, Monsterous bubble, Rough Drumbus.

Create a walking skeleton through:

* Configure sonic environment
* Sequencing
* Chart some courses through the labyrinth
* Mangle and mixdown audio 

Configure sound generation environment

* Sound generators
* Control 
* User interface
* Programming 
* Network
