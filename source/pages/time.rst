Conceptions of time

Linear time and modernity
-------------------------

The linear conception of time dominates the modern world. It bids us to construct it.

Bronze age, monotheistic religions had the idea of salvation:
a process directed into the future. Technology certainly works that way. The spring wound 
mechanical clocks used in fourteenth  century were a prelude to the scientific-technological advances 
of  modernity. Newton's  physics established time as a quantifiable  arrow. The Great Western Railway 
syncronised railway time across England in November 1840.

Time becomes a loop
-------------------

Today we are certain that time  itself  runs  on  and  does  not return. However, notions of non-linear 
(periodic or cycical) time remain. The phenomenal sense of temporal continuity is periodic.

A mind that seeks
-----------------

The circular experience of time, our experience of time, syncronised with the world. A mind which 
rewards just-manageable challenges, clear proximal goals, and immediate feedback. Inventive and 
curious behavoiral traits. Friendly or compassionate engagemen with others. A sensitive or nervous 
affect.

The regulator is phasic dopaminergic signaling that orients us toward novel, surprising, or uncertain stimuli. And 
meta-monitoring processes that track our learning progress and stop us getting trapped. The illusion of 
self-determination.
