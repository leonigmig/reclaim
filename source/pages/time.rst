Conceptions of time
*******************

Linear time and modernity
-------------------------

The linear conception of time dominates the modern world. It bids us to construct it.

Bronze age, monotheistic religions had the idea of salvation:
a process directed into the future. Technology certainly works that way. The spring wound 
mechanical clocks used in fourteenth  century were a prelude to the scientific-technological advances 
of  modernity. Newton's  physics established time as a quantifiable  arrow. The Great Western Railway 
syncronised railway time across England in November 1840.

Time becomes a loop
-------------------

Today we are certain that time  itself  runs  on  and  does  not return. However, notions of non-linear 
(periodic or cycical) time remain. The phenomenal sense of temporal continuity is periodic.

A mind that seeks
-----------------

The circular experience of time, our experience of time, syncronised with the world. A mind which 
rewards just-manageable challenges, clear proximal goals, and immediate feedback. Inventive and 
curious behavoiral traits. Friendly or compassionate engagemen with others. A sensitive or nervous 
affect.

The regulator is phasic dopaminergic signaling that orients us toward novel, surprising, or uncertain stimuli. And 
meta-monitoring processes that track our learning progress and stop us getting trapped. The illusion of 
self-determination.

The coming `Counterculture`_
----------------------------

People will experience so much of the material living conditions as outside their nexus of control, they 
will start to seek other groups and cultures which promise to better fulfil their `needs`_.
