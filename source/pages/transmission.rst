The Coming Transmission System
******************************

Described by `FSOL`_ as the journey from millennial claustrophobia to open-ended cosmic consciousness.

Psychedelia relates to the natural state of a child. Naive mirror neutrons captured in their 
elemental state of awe. The mirror can be the mimic, the memory, harmonious and engaged. 

The enemy of the overwrought defensive model that embeds nuerosis, fight, flight, freeze.

Able to speak and hear - highly evolved categories. We ourselves are simply complex disturbances of quantum fields, able 
to emit and recieve. We have emotions thought of as unconscious, or deeper than conscious constructs and foundations. These 
internal fields are how we tell stories to ourselves as we pass through time. 

Ordered reflections. Dreams and visions and emotions. The layer in between the stable and the varying. 

Through a practice of deep listening, an awareness of the spatiality of sound phenomenon. Take some of these escapist
 ideas seriously.

The utility of `Counterculture`_
--------------------------------

People will experience so much of the material living conditions as outside their nexus of control, they 
will start to seek other groups and cultures which promise to better fulfil their `needs`_.

Escapism
--------

The attempt to avoid awareness of aversive beliefs. The function of escapism is a compensation for exposure to other irrational patterns of belief formation, particular in 
so far as those belief systems would lead to dispair. 

As a child in Jamaica, Grace Jones had only one schoolfriend and was teased by classmates for her "skinny frame". Moving to the
US at 13 she "absolutely hated" her mother's new husband, he regularly beat her in what Jones described as "serious abuse". As
a young woman she immersed herself in the Counterculture of the 1960s by living in hippie communes, earning money as a go-go dancer, 
and using LSD and other drugs. She later praised the use of LSD as "a very important part of my emotional growth... The mental 
exercise was good for me".

     "Ultimately, it required a certain amount of clear thinking, a lot of hard work and good make-up to be accepted as a freak."

Recapitulation
--------------

The starting point is dystopic claustrophobia. Unrestrained technology, internet of corporate interests, attention hijack,
disinformation, misinformation and trivia. Yet distopic claustraphobia is nothing new. The goal is not to revolutionise it. To
follow a well trodden, but still dangerous path. But to live in a way that escapes or evades the closing in.

Heighten Sensation
------------------

Repose in the sensation that rests us from intense compulsion to focus, analyse, frame, categorise, isolate. 
That which energises us makes us live richly. That which reinforces support emotional freedom. Close friends
 and family help us maintain perspective and laugh.

Sex
---

Entirely mysterious. You must do it how you like.
