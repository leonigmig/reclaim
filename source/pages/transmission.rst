described by `FSOL`_ as the journey from millennial claustrophobia to open-ended cosmic consciousness

To me the word psychedelia relates to the natural state of a child

Mirror neutrons seem a closer match

We have emotions thought of as unconscious, or deeper than conscious constructs and foundations

The mirror can be the mimic, the memory, harmonious and engaged. Or the overwrought defensive model that embeds nuerosis, fight, flight, freeze.

The layer in between the stable and the varying

Able to speak and hear - highly evolved categories

through a practice of deep listening, an awareness of the spatiality of sound phenomenon

Take some of these escapist ideas seriously

The utility of `Counterculture`_
--------------------------------

People will experience so much of the material living conditions as outside their nexus of control, they 
will start to seek other groups and cultures which promise to better fulfil their `needs`_.

Escapism
--------

The attempt to avoid awareness of aversive beliefs. The function of escapism is a compensation for exposure to other irrational patterns of belief formation, particular in 
so far as those belief systems would lead to dispair. 

As a child in Jamaica, Grace Jones had only one schoolfriend and was teased by classmates for her "skinny frame". Moving to the
US at 13 she "absolutely hated" her mother's new husband, he regularly beat her in what Jones described as "serious abuse". As
a young woman she immersed herself in the Counterculture of the 1960s by living in hippie communes, earning money as a go-go dancer, 
and using LSD and other drugs. She later praised the use of LSD as "a very important part of my emotional growth... The mental 
exercise was good for me".

     "Ultimately, it required a certain amount of clear thinking, a lot of hard work and good make-up to be accepted as a freak."

Recapitulation
--------------

The starting point is dystopic claustrophobia. Unrestrained technology, internet of corporate interests, attention hijack,
disinformation, misinformation and trivia. Yet distopic claustraphobia is nothing new. The goal is not to revolutionise it. To
follow a well trodden, but still dangerous path. But to live in a way that escapes or evades the closing in.

Heighten Sensation
------------------

Repose in the sensation of sound which rests us from our intense compulsion to focus, analyse, frame, categorise, isolate. 
Sounds which energise us live richly. Sounds which reinforce and support our emotional independence. Which build our 
resources support our relationships with close friends and family.

If one is analytic what is the other? What are it sources? Kabbalah tree of life
