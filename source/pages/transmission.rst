The Coming Transmission System

described by `FSOL`_ as the journey from millennial claustrophobia to open-ended cosmic consciousness

To me the word psychedelia relates to the natural state of a child

Mirror neutrons seem a closer match

We have emotions thought of as unconscious, or deeper than conscious constructs and foundations

The mirror can be the mimic, the memory, harmonious and engaged. Or the overwrought defensive model that embeds nuerosis, fight, flight, freeze.

The layer in between the stable and the varying

Able to speak and hear - highly evolved categories

through a practice of deep listening, an awareness of the spatiality of sound phenomenon

Take some of these escapist ideas seriously

The utility of `Counterculture`_
--------------------------------

People will experience so much of the material living conditions as outside their nexus of control, they 
will start to seek other groups and cultures which promise to better fulfil their `needs`_.

Escapism
--------

The attempt to avoid awareness of aversive beliefs. The function of escapism is a compensation for exposure to other irrational patterns of belief formation, particular in 
so far as those belief systems would lead to dispair. 

    As a child in Jamaica, Grace Jones had only one schoolfriend and was teased by classmates for her "skinny frame".
    Moving to the US at 13 she "absolutely hated" her mother's new husband, he regularly beat her in what Jones described as "serious abuse".
    As a young woman she immersed herself in the Counterculture of the 1960s by living in hippie communes, earning money as a go-go dancer, and using LSD and other drugs. She later praised the use of LSD as "a very important part of my emotional growth... The mental exercise was good for me".
